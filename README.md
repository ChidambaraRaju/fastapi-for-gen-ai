# 🚀 FastAPI Learning Journey

Welcome to my **FastAPI Learning Repository**!  
This repo documents my step-by-step journey of learning **FastAPI** as part of my preparation to become an **Agentic AI Developer**.  

It contains:
- 📘 Notes (`.md` files) explaining concepts in simple terms  
- 💻 Code examples (`.py` files) that go hand-in-hand with the notes  
- 📂 Structured flow so you can follow along like a mini-course
